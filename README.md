**Re:Draw - Context Aware Translation as a Controllable Method for Artistic Production**

In Proceedings of the 33rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence

*We introduce context-aware translation, a novel method that combines the benefits of inpainting and image-to-image translation, respecting simultaneously the original input and contextual relevance -- where existing methods fall short. By doing so, our method opens new avenues for the controllable use of AI within artistic creation, from animation to digital art.*

*As an use case, we apply our method to redraw any hand-drawn animated character eyes based on any design specifications -- eyes serve as a focal point that captures viewer attention and conveys a range of emotions, however, the labor-intensive nature of traditional animation often leads to compromises in the complexity and consistency of eye design. Furthermore, we remove the need for production data for training and introduce a new character recognition method that surpasses existing work by not requiring fine-tuning to specific productions. This proposed use case could help maintain consistency throughout production and unlock bolder and more detailed design choices without the production cost drawbacks. A user study shows context-aware translation is preferred over existing work 95.16% of the time.*
